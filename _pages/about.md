Hello, I'm Danny.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/me.jpg" alt="Me!">


For my day job, I work as a mechanical engineer designing equipment for the entertainment industry. In my free time, I build things, develop software and dabble in creating art. You can see examples of what I get up to on my Github and my posts on this website.

I enjoy exploring the intersection between electronics, engineering and the arts. I'm interested in 3D printing, generative design, Twitter bots, and a whole host of other things.

Lately, I've been working on generating 3D prints from unusual data sources, like my Pendulum Bowl Generator.

If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to tweet or email me!
